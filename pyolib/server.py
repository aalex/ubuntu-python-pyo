### Proxy of Server object
######################################################################
class Server(object):
    """
    Main processing audio loop callback handler.
    
    The Server object handles all communications with Portaudio and 
    Portmidi. It keeps track of all audio streams created as well as
    connections between them. 
    
    An instance of the Server must be booted before defining any 
    signal processing chain.

    Parameters:

    sr : int, optional
        Sampling rate used by Portaudio and the Server to compute samples. 
        Defaults to 44100.
    nchnls : int, optional
        Number of input and output channels. Defaults to 2.
    buffersize : int, optional
        Number of samples that Portaudio will request from the callback loop. 
        This value has an impact on CPU use (a small buffer size is harder 
        to compute) and on the latency of the system. Latency is 
        `buffer size / sampling rate` in seconds. Defaults to 256.
    duplex : int {0, 1}, optional
        Input - output mode. 0 is output only and 1 is both ways. 
        Defaults to 1.

    Methods:

    setAmp(x) : Set the overall amplitude.
    boot() : Boot the server. Must be called before defining any signal 
        processing chain.
    shutdown() : Shut down and clear the server.
    start() : Start the audio callback loop.
    stop() : Stop the audio callback loop.
    recstart(str) : Begins recording of the sound sent to output. 
        This method creates a file called `pyo_rec.aif` in the 
        user's home directory if a path is not supplied.
    recstop() : Stops previously started recording.
    getSamplingRate() : Returns the current sampling rate.
    getNchnls() : Returns the current number of channels.
    getBufferSize() : Returns the current buffer size.
    getIsStarted() : Returns 1 if the server is started, otherwise returns 0.

    The next methods must be called before booting the server

    setInOutDevice(x) : Set both input and output devices. See `pa_list_devices()`.
    setInputDevice(x) : Set the audio input device number. See `pa_list_devices()`.
    setOutputDevice(x) : Set the audio output device number. See `pa_list_devices()`.
    setMidiInputDevice(x) : Set the MIDI input device number. See `pm_list_devices()`.
    setSamplingRate(x) : Set the sampling rate used by the server.
    setBufferSize(x) : Set the buffer size used by the server.
    setNchnls(x) : Set the number of channels used by the server.
    setDuplex(x) : Set the duplex mode used by the server.

    Attributes:
    
    amp : Overall amplitude of the Server. This value is applied on any 
        stream sent to the soundcard.
        
    Examples:
    
    >>> # For an 8 channels server in duplex mode with
    >>> # a sampling rate of 48000 Hz and buffer size of 512
    >>> s = Server(sr=48000, nchnls=8, buffersize=512, duplex=1).boot()
    >>> s.start()
